					<p>Hello world! My name is Aaron Lee. I moved to Austin, TX two years ago and like many fell in live with the city. My father was in the military so I was born in Denver, CO but I grew up in Clarksville, TN. I attended college at Auburn University in Auburn, AL. I studied digital art with a focus on 3D art.</p><br>
					<p>I am very excited about the possibilies that this class will bring me once I have successfully graduated. I do have some coding experience with HTML/CSS, however, this homework assignment was very fun. I was a great way to dust off some of the cobwebs so to speak. Every class/assignment is a new learning experience that is helping ignite my passion for web development!</p>
